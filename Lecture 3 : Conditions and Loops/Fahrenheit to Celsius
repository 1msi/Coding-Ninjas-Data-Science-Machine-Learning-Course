# Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question

## Note : For printing multiple values in one line, put them inside print separated by space.
## You can follow this syntax for printing values of two variables val1 and val2 separaetd by space -
##      print(val1, " ", val2)
s=int(input())
e=int(input())
w=int(input())
i=s
while i<=e:
    print(i,int((i-32)*(5/9)))
    i=i+w
